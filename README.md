# MultiplayerRobotSoccerSimulation
 This is a senior design project that explore real-time multiplayer game simulation for robot soccer, leveraging the "What You See Is What I See" (WYSIWIS) paradigm, which allows players to share a unified view in collaborative environments. For our approach we will utilize Webot programming tools to simulate soccer games for autonomous robots.
